# Permissions Rationale

Every entry in `manifest.json` under `permissions` and `host_permissions` must
have a matching `## <permission>` section below. The `store:check` tests fail
if a permission is added to the manifest without a documented rationale, or if
a rationale is shorter than 60 characters.

The text in each section is what we paste into the Chrome Web Store
"Justification" fields at submission time, so write it for a human reviewer,
not for ourselves.

## storage

The extension persists the most recent usage snapshot, the cached Claude
organization id, and the user's overlay preferences in `chrome.storage.local`
so they survive service worker restarts and tab reloads. Nothing is read from
or written to any other storage backend.

## alarms

A single recurring `chrome.alarms` entry wakes the service worker every five
minutes to re-fetch the usage limits. Without it the badge and overlay would
only update while the popup was open, which defeats the at-a-glance use case.

## cookies

Used to read the `lastActiveOrg` cookie from `claude.ai` so the extension can
build the correct `/api/organizations/{id}/usage` URL for the user's currently
selected organization. The cookie value is never copied off-device and is only
read, never written.

## host: https://claude.ai/*

Required to call the authenticated Claude usage endpoints
(`/api/organizations` and `/api/organizations/{id}/usage`) with the user's
existing session cookies, and to mount the on-page overlay next to the chat
input. No requests are made to any other path on this host.

## host: https://chatgpt.com/*

Required to call `/api/auth/session` (to obtain the short-lived access token
the chatgpt.com web app already uses) and `/backend-api/wham/usage` (the rate
limit endpoint), and to mount the on-page overlay on the Codex chat surface.
No other endpoints are accessed.

## host: https://chat.openai.com/*

The legacy ChatGPT host that still resolves for some accounts. Same usage as
`chatgpt.com` above: reading the user's own rate-limit data via their existing
session and rendering the on-page overlay. Kept so signed-in users who land on
the legacy domain see the same experience.
